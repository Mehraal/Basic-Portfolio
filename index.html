        <p> I am a sport fanatic, specially Football which is called soccer in US. I have been palying Football for over 20 years now and I used to play in local leagues.
            I had lots of fun playing soccer,but I should have persuit it in professional way, and I regret that I did not do that.I am also a movie lover and any chance I get, I watch a movie.
            Right now I am focusing on the new path I chose for my future and that is the Coding Bootcamp I enrolled in and I know that with hard work and practice I can become a great web developer and that will open many doors for me to be successful.</p>
         
        <p>I returned back to school after almost 15 years to become a web developer. Coding is fun and exciting, but it requires plenty of focus and patience. I found out that UCI is offering this course and 
             I decided to enroll and now after 2 weeks, I know that this was the best decision I made. </p>
