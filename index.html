        <p> I am a sport fanatic, specially Football which is called soccer in US. I have been palying Football for over 20 years now and I used to play in local leagues.
            I had lots of fun playing soccer, and I should have persuit it in professional way. Now I regret that I did not follow that path. I am also a movie lover and any chance I get, and my dream was to become an Actor.
            </p>
        <p> Right now I am focusing on the new path I chose for my future and that is the Coding Bootcamp I enrolled in and I know that
            with hard work and practice I can become a great web developer and that will open many doors for me to become successful.I returned back to school after almost 15 years to become a web developer. Coding is fun and exciting, but it requires plenty of focus and patience. I found out that UCI is offering this course and 
            I decided to enroll and now after 2 weeks, I know that this was the best decision I made. </p>
