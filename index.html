        <p> I am a sport fanatic, specialy Football which is called soccer in US. I have been palying Football for over 20 years now and i used to play in local leagues.
            I had lots of fun playing soccer,but I should have persuit it in professional way, and I regret that i did not do that.I am also a movie lover and any chance I get, I watch a movie or two.</p>
         
        <p>I am going to school to become a web developer. coding is fun and esciting,but it is hard and requires plenty of focus and patience. I found out that UCI is offering this course and since i live computers and coding, I decided to enroll. I am having fun at the class and learning a lot in a fast pace course. </p>
